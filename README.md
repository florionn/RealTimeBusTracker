# Real Time Bus Tracker

In this exercise we will show all the bus stops from MIT to Harvard. To start the animation hit the button on the top left corner that says “Show stops between MIT and Harvard” and a tracker will start moving along the path and show all the bus stops from MIT all the way to the Harvard campus.
